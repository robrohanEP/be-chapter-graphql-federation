# Bramble Spike with Two Fake Services

## Building Docker

You'll need to `Docker build` the Bramble and Graphql-Spiker sub folders. If you're on a Mac or Linux you can use the `Makefiles` (if you are on windows, look inside the Makefile and run the commands from within the `build` task by hand):

```shell
$ cd bramble
$ make build
```

**Note:** that with Bramble you might need to change the `ARCH` variable so that bramble is compiled for the correct architecture.

```shell
$ cd graphql-spiker
$ make build
```

Once this is done, you should have two images, one for Bramble and one for Graphql-Spiker:

```shell
be-chapter-graphql-federation main ðŸ¦‰> docker images
REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
bramble          latest    0c031615c75a   2 hours ago   17.7MB
graphql-spiker   latest    3b61a023e082   2 hours ago   134MB
```

## Running Docker Compose

From there you should be able to run the docker-compose file in the root of the project:

**Note:** you might have to change the `platform` settings in the `docker-compose.yml` file because it is again setup for an M1 Mac.

```shell
be-chapter-graphql-federation main ðŸ¦‰> docker compose up

## Interacting with Bramble

Once all the docker kinks are worked out, you can interact with the bramble admin area by going here: [http://localhost:8083/admin](http://localhost:8083/admin)

![Admin Area](assets/admin.png)

And you can query the combined schema here: [http://localhost:8082/playground](http://localhost:8082/playground)

### Example query

This query will do a single query that will hit both example services:

```gql
query{
  traits {
    id
    portal
    label
    category {
      id
      text
    }
  }
}
```

![Query Image](assets/fedquery.png)

Most data comes from `service1`; the `portal` data, however, comes from `service2`.

### View Query Plan

To prove this, you can set the following header at the bottom of the query tool and re-running the query:

```json
{
  "X-Bramble-Debug": "all"
}
```

![Query Plan](assets/plan.png)

This will add a bunch of verbose debugging output to the query that you can have a look through.
